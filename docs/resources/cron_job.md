# render_cron_job (Resource)

Provides a Render Cron Job resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "render_cron_job" "cron-job-example" {
  name               = "example-cron-job"
  plan               = "starter"
  region             = "ohio"
  runtime            = "python"
  schedule           = "30 2 * * *" // Run daily at 2:30 AM
  start_command      = "echo 'cron job running'"
  pre_deploy_command = "pip install -r requirements.txt"

  runtime_source = {
    native_runtime = {
      auto_deploy   = true
      branch        = "master"
      build_command = "pip install -r requirements.txt"
      build_filter = {
        ignored_paths = ["cronjob/tests/**"]
        paths         = ["cronjob/**"]
      }
      repo_url = "https://github.com/render-examples/flask-hello-world"
      runtime  = "python"
    }
  }

  env_vars = {
    "key1" = { value = "val1" },
    "key2" = { value = "val2" },
  }
}

## Schema

- `name` (String) Name of the service
- `plan` (String) Plan to use for the service. Must be one of `starter`, `standard`, `pro`, `pro_plus`, `pro_max`, `pro_ultra`, or a custom plan.
- `region` (String) [Region](https://render.com/docs/regions) to deploy the service. One of `frankfurt`, `ohio`, `oregon`, `singapore`, `virginia`.
- `runtime_source` (Attributes) Source of the build artifacts or image that run your service. You must provide one of [native_runtime](https://render.com/docs/native-runtimes), [docker](https://render.com/docs/docker), or [image](https://render.com/docs/deploy-an-image). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--runtime_source))
- `schedule` (String) Cron schedule to run the job

### Optional

- `env_vars` (Attributes Map) Map of environment variable names to their values. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--env_vars))
- `environment_id` (String) ID of the [project environment](https://render.com/docs/projects) that the resource belongs to
- `log_stream_override` (Attributes) Configure the [log stream override settings](https://render.com/docs/log-streams#overriding-defaults) for this service. These will override the global log stream settings of the user or team. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--log_stream_override))
- `notification_override` (Attributes) Configure the [notification settings](https://render.com/docs/notifications) for this service. These will override the global notification settings of the user or team. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--notification_override))
- `root_directory` (String) When you specify a [root directory](https://render.com/docs/monorepo-support#root-directory), Render runs all your commands in the specified directory and ignores changes outside the directory. Defaults to the repository root.
- `secret_files` (Attributes Map) A map of secret file paths to their contents. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--secret_files))
- `start_command` (String) Command to run the service. When using native runtimes, this will be used as the start command and is required. For [Docker](https://render.com/docs/docker) and [image-backed](https://render.com/docs/deploy-an-image) services, this will override the default Docker command for the image.

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the service
- `slug` (String) Unique slug for the service
